# Potions

[Potions](https://www.potions.dev/Welcome-to-the-Potion-Shop-ee919c15f8e6410f9c20e3c6af486430) make it possible to build widgets for [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) pages by directly embedding HTML snippets. Each snippet has a random URL associated with it, allowing you to embed the link directly. 

I plan to keep a running list of widgets I've created below. If you want to embed a widget as-is, use the listed URL. If you'd like to make modifications, use the source code provided and create a new Potion using [this link](https://potions.potions.dev/widgets/), then embed the new Potion's URL. Of course, you can also make a completely new widget from scratch.

## Widgets
- **Randomized work quotes** [[demo](https://potions.potions.dev/widgets/qgB2ttK7gmd8YxnPEUYkaU2ss3p2/0evsxjjo0yw9ehbcq2y80shg0)] [[source](workQuotes.html)]  
Shows a random "inspirational" work quote every time you refresh the page. The list of quotes is hardcoded in the source.
